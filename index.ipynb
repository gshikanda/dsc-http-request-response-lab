This takes live raw data from NASA's systems and turn them into APIs related to space and spacecraft. We can access the following information from open notify. \n","\n","* Current Location of the International Space Station\n","\n","* Number of People in Space\n","\n","* Overhead Pass Predictions for the International Space Station\n","    \n","### API endpoints\n","\n","Open Notify has several API endpoints. \n",">An endpoint is a server route that is used to retrieve different data from the API. \n","\n","For example, the `/comments` endpoint on the Reddit API might retrieve information about comments, whereas the `/users` endpoint might retrieve data about users. To access them, you would add the endpoint to the base url of the API.\n","\n","For the OpenNotify API, we have the following endpoints: \n","\n","1. Current Location of the International Space Station `/iss-now.json`\n","2. Number of People in Space `/astros.json`\n","3. Overhead Pass Predictions for the International Space Station `/iss-pass.json`    \n","\n","The `.json` extension simply tells us that the data is being returned in a JSON format.\n","\n","In this lab, we'll be querying this API to retrieve live data about the International Space Station (ISS).
